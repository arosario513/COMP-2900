# Data Structures Introduction

## Intro

- Data structures are ways of storing and organizing information inside a program
- Choosing a the correct data structure can help making certains tasks(eg. searching, sorting, adding, and deleting) easier.

## Primitive and Non-Primitive Data

| Data          | Definition                                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primitive     | The most basic form of data                                    |
| Non-Primitive | Allows for large data to organized in a more sophisticated way |

## Types of Data Structures

| Structure    | Definition                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Array        | A collection of elements with the same datatype which are stored side by side                        |
| Linked Lists | Composed by nodes which may point to other nodes; doesn't have a fixed size                          |
| Stack        | The last element added is the first one that goes out. Useful for functions that need to be reverted |
| Queue        | First element is the one that gets out. It's like the reverse of a stack                             |
| Tree         | Hiearchal structures made from nodes                                                                 |
| Graphs       | Generalization of trees in which the nodes can be related to other nodes                             |
